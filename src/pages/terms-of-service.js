          Third-Party Account, and without obligating us to pay any fees or
          making us subject to any usage limitations imposed by the third-party

          you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in
          such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that
          you post to your Third-Party Accounts may be available on and through
          your account on the Site. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or
          associated service becomes unavailable or our access to such Third
          Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then
          Social Network Content may no longer be available on and through the
          Site. You will have the ability to disable the connection between your
          account on the Site and your Third-Party Accounts at any time. PLEASE

          ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR
