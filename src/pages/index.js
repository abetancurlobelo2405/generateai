Dr. Zangaddar spent his days tinkering in his laboratory, coming up with all sorts of wild inventions. He dreamed of taking over the world one day, so every invention was designed with this goal in mind. His most impressive invention was a robotic army programmed to do his bidding. One fateful day, Dr. Zangaddar created a ray gun capable of controlling the minds of anyone it strikes. Armed with this new weapon, Dr. Zangaddar set off on his quest for global domination. He began to take over small villages and towns, one by one. Soon enough, the whole world was under his control.",

The tipping point was reached when the temperature of the planet reached an unstable level. Atmospheric warming events occurred in a domino effect that rapidly spread across the planet resulting in extreme temperatures, rising sea levels, hurricanes, and droughts. Due to the rising sea levels, many countries were left uninhabitable and had to relocate their citizens to safe places around the world. The global economy reached a breaking point and governments had to make certain sacrifices in order to save their citizens. The extreme weather conditions became too much for the planet. Natural disasters occurred around the world, contributing to the end of the world. Crops failed, communities starved, and the human population dwindled.",
